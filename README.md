OBJECTIVE 
This project is wrtten in java using concepts of lists in the collection framework.
The objective of this project is to analyze business data from .CSV file from SF Business Database. 

ABOUT MY EXECUTION
My project runs and compiles without any error. 
Extensive comments are provided in the code to understand each methods and its functionality. 
I have included all the classes in same file to make it easier to follow all codes in this project.
I have also improved on the data so if anything is missing my code inserts "" as a default value so all businesses are being captured and nothing is skipped even if its missing data in csv file. 
I have made my command input by user to be case insensitive. 
When a command in input by user of a certain zip or NAICS code summary my output gives the correct statistics but if invalid command is input the out is invalid command and user is asked to type the command again.
Quit- stops the execution.  


TIME: 
The time it take for my code to produce output is 2-5 seconds. 

OTHER COMMENTS: 
In my code while printing summary, for New Business in last year: I am getting output of 0. I am unable to find any problem with my code, so I believe it could be the data set that I have.
